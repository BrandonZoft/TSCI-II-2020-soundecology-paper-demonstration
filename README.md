Using R's "soundecology" to demonstrate a dissertation for measuring biodiversity in a forest landscape. This project was made for the class of [Tópicos Selectos de Ciencias de la Ingeniería II - AGO-DIC 2020.](https://www.fime.uanl.mx/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Topicos-Selectos-de-Ciencias-de-la-Ingenieria-II.pdf)

Using R's "soundecology" package, this sets of files and code demonstrates “Connecting soundscape to lanscape: Which acoustic index best describes landscape
configuration?” (Susan Fuller) with a set of sounds used from three specific sources (not seen in this repo) and latter applied to different functions of soundecology, seewave and tuneR, then latter plotted with Python and matplotlib.
